# AS_P4_OMR_Mimic
Problem: OMR sheets are costly and reading off answers through them takes time... not to mention that after which discard is inconvenient. Also, in schools and other educational
         institutions, mock tests are usually held for competetive exams. As OMR readers are costly, computer vision can be used to efficiently solve the above problem.

Solution: Design specific OMR papers for distribution.
          Develop a pipeline to process an image of the sheet with marked answers and read all of them.
          Develop a desktop or mobile application to click images, accept answer keys and check the answer sheet.
          
Tools: Python, OpenCV2
          
Sidenote: The project was developed with clear intention for school purposes only and may not be work for other usecases until further modifications...
